### LilacProject

#### About: 

1.   A Front-End and Back-End JAVA software project created by Eclipse and manages online flowers store with different branches around the country.
2.   Enables registering as a customer, manager or employee with the option of also entering as a guest and buying from the store.
3.   Managers and employees can also manage the items in the  store.
4.   The store connects to a remote SQL Database on phpmyAdmin in order to execute orders from the server.

#### IMPORTANT : In order to view the complete server code go to the src folder, then to the ocsf folder and click on the file LilacServer.java which contains all the server code.
